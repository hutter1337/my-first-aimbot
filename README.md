# my-first-aimbot
An aimbot I created for the game assault cube to learn how cheats are made.

There are a lot of things that I could have added like checking to see if the target is behind a wall, including distance into the targeting, and detecting how many entities there are rather than asking for that information. I hope I can work on this project again soon.
