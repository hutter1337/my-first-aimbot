# my-first-aimbot
An aimbot I created for the game assault cube to learn how cheats are made.

there are a lot of things i could have added like checking to see if the target is behind a wall, including distance into the targeting, and detecting how many entities there are rather than asking for that information, but I figured that I achieved what I was trying to achieve when I started this little project. This was just a learning exercise for me to dip my toe into game hacking and I think I will return to this project but with a diferent game because I did find it quite fun.
